Encapsulation :-
    -> It refers to the concept of restricting access to certain parts of an object and its data.
    -> The primary goal of encapsulation is to hide the internal details of an object and
        provide a well-defined interface for interacting with it.
    -> This helps in maintaining the integrity and consistency of the object's data.
    -> Encapsulation can be implemented using several mechanisms in object-oriented programming language.
    -> These mechanisms allow you to control access to the internal data and behavior of an object.
    -> We can implement Encapsulation Using many mechanism :-
        1) Private Variable
        2) Name Mangling
        3) Getter & Setter

Example :-
    Suppose we create class and that class have many private methods and many private variables !
    So in this case, We can say class is implementing the concept of Encapsulation.
    That means we can say the class is capsule and the methods & variables are private data of that capsule(class).
    We can not use the private methods and private variables outside the class.

Note :-
    So if we have to modify the value of private variable,
    Then it's a good practice to use Getter & Setter method rather than Name Mangling !
