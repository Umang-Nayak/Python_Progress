Inheritance :-
    -> Inheritance allows to create a new class by inheriting properties and methods from an existing class.
    -> That means a class can use all the properties of the other class.
    -> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).
    -> A class that inherited by another class is called a parent class.
    -> A class that use all properties of parent class is called child class.
    -> Child class have more access than parent class.
    -> There are total 5 types of inheritance in python :-
        1) Single Inheritance
            ( A ---> B ) (1 Parent class to 1 Child class)
        2) Multiple Inheritance
            ( A & B ---> C ) (2 Parent class to 1 Child class)
        3) Multilevel Inheritance   ( A ---> B ---> C )
            ((1 Parent class to 1 Child class) & (1 Child class to 1 Grand Child class))
        4) Hierarchical Inheritance
            ( A ---> B & C ) (1 Parent class to 2 Child class)
        5) Hybrid Inheritance
            ( A ---> B & C ---> D ) (combination of different types of inheritance)
