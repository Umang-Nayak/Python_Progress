*) JOIN :-
	A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, 
	based on a related column between them.

Different Types of SQL JOINs :-
	i) (INNER) JOIN :-
		Returns records that have matching values in both tables
	ii) LEFT (OUTER) JOIN :- 
		Returns all records from the left table, 
		and the matched records from the right table
	iii) RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN :- 
		Returns all records from the right table, 
		and the matched records from the left table
	iv) FULL (OUTER) JOIN :- 
		Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table


1) INNER JOIN :-
	The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
	
	Tip :- 
	JOIN and INNER JOIN are the same.

	Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
	
	Note :- 
	The INNER JOIN keyword returns only rows with a match in both tables.

	Naming the Columns :-
	It is a good practice to include the table name when specifying columns in the SQL statement.
	The Query works without specifying table names, 
	because none of the specified column names are present in both tables.
	
	JOIN or INNER JOIN :-
	JOIN and INNER JOIN will return the same result.
	INNER is the default join type for JOIN, so when you write JOIN the parser actually writes INNER JOIN.
	
	
2) LEFT JOIN :-
	The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), 
	and the matching records from the right table (table2). 
	The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

	Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
	
	Note :- 
	The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table, 
	even if there are no matches in the right table.
	
	
3) RIGHT JOIN :-
	The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), 
	and the matching records from the left table (table1). 
	The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.

	Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
	
	Note :- 
	In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
	The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table, 
	even if there are no matches in the left table.


4) FULL OUTER JOIN :-
	The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

	Tip :- 
	FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

	Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
	WHERE condition;
	
	Note :- 
	FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!
	The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. 
	So, if there are rows in "table1" that do not have matches in "table2", 
	or if there are rows in "table2" that do not have matches in "table1", 
	those rows will be listed as well.
	

5) Self Join :-
	A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

	Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 T1, table1 T2 WHERE condition;
	
	Note :-
	T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.
