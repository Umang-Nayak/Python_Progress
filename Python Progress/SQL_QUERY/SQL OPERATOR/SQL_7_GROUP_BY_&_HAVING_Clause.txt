*) GROUP BY :-
	The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
	The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) 
	to group the result-set by one or more columns.
	
Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition
	GROUP BY column_name(s) ORDER BY column_name(s);
	
	
*) HAVING Clause :-
	The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword 
	cannot be used with aggregate functions.

Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition
	GROUP BY column_name(s) HAVING condition ORDER BY column_name(s);
