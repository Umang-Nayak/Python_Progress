1) IN :-
	The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
	The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
	
Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, valueN);
	
	
2) NOT IN :-
	By using the NOT keyword in front of the IN operator, 
	you return all records that are NOT any of the values in the list.
	
Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name NOT IN (value1, valueN);
	

3) IN (SELECT) :-
	You can also use IN with a subquery in the WHERE clause.
	With a subquery you can return all records from the main 
	query that are present in the result of the subquery.
	
Syntax :-
	SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (SELECT column_name FROM table_name);
	
	
4) NOT IN (SELECT) :-
	You can also use NOT IN with a subquery in the WHERE clause.
	With a subquery you can return all records from the main 
	query that are not present in the result of the subquery.

Syntax :-	
	SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name NOT IN (SELECT column_name FROM table_name);
	
	
5) BETWEEN :-
	The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. 
	The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
	The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
	
	
6) NOT BETWEEN :-
	To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN.
	
Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name NOT BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
	

7) BETWEEN with IN :-
	The following SQL statement selects all values with a column between value1 and value2.

Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name 
	BETWEEN value1 AND value2 AND column_name IN (value1,value2,valueN);
	
	
8) BETWEEN Text Values :-
	The following SQL statement selects all values with a Pro 
	alphabetically between TextValue1 and TextValue2.

Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name 
	BETWEEN 'TextValue1' AND 'TextValue2' ORDER BY column_name;
	

9)	NOT BETWEEN Text Values :-
	The following SQL statement selects all values with 
	a column not between TextValue1 and TextValue2.

Syntax :-	
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name 
	NOT BETWEEN 'TextValue1' AND 'TextValue2' ORDER BY column_name;
	

10) BETWEEN Dates :-
	The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate 
	between '01-July-1996' and '31-July-1996'.

Syntax :-
	1st :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN #MM/DD/YYYY# AND #MM/DD/YYYY#;
	2nd :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND 'YYYY-MM-DD';
