*) ANY and ALL Operators :-
	The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison 
	between a single column value and a range of other values.

1) ANY :-
	It returns a boolean value as a result.
	It returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition.
	ANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.

	Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name operator ANY
	(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
	
	Note :-
	The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).
	
2) ALL :-
	It returns a boolean value as a result.
	It returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition.
	It is used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements.
	ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range. 

	Syntax :- 
		ALL with SELECT :-
		SELECT ALL column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
		
		ALL with WHERE or HAVING :-
		SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator ALL
		(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
		
	Note :- 
	The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).
