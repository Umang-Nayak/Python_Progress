1) UNION :-
	The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
	Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns.
	The columns must also have similar data types.
	The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order.
	
	
	Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
	UNION
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
	
2) UNION ALL :-
	The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. 
	To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL.

	Syntax :-
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
	UNION ALL
	SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
	
Note :- 
	The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.
	If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, 
	because UNION selects only distinct values. 
	Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!
	

3) UNION With WHERE :-
	The following SQL statement returns the German cities (only distinct values) 
	from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table.

	Example :-
	SELECT City, Country FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany'
	UNION	
	SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers WHERE Country='Germany'
	ORDER BY City;
	
4) UNION ALL With WHERE :-
	The following SQL statement returns the German cities (duplicate values also) 
	from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table.

	Example :-
	SELECT City, Country FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany'
	UNION ALL
	SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers WHERE Country='Germany'
	ORDER BY City;
