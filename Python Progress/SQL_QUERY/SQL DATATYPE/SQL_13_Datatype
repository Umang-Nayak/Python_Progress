Datatype :-
    SQL (Structured Query Language) supports several data types that are used to define
    the kind of data that can be stored in a database table.
Note :-
    The specific data types available may slightly depending on the database management system (DBMS) we are using !
    but here are some common SQL data types:


1) Numeric Data Types :-

    i) INT (Integer) :-
        Description = Used to store whole numbers.
        Size = 32-bit
        Range = (-2.1 billion to 2.1 billion)

    ii) SMALLINT :-
        Description = Stores smaller integer values than INT.
        Size = 16-bit
        Range = (-32,768 to 32,767)

    iii) BIGINT :-
        Description = Stores large integer values.
        Size = 64-bit
        Range = (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
                (-9,223 quadrillion to 9,223 quadrillion)

    iv) DECIMAL(p, s) :- Represents fixed-point numbers with a specified precision (p) and scale (s).

    v) NUMERIC(p, s) :- Similar to DECIMAL, for fixed-point numbers.

    vi) FLOAT(p) :- Used to store approximate numeric values with a specified precision (p).
    vii) REAL :- Stores single-precision floating-point numbers.
    DOUBLE PRECISION: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers.
    Character String Data Types:

    CHAR(n): Fixed-length character strings with a specified length (n).
    VARCHAR(n): Variable-length character strings with a maximum length of n.
    TEXT: Stores large amounts of text data.
    Date and Time Data Types:

    DATE: Stores dates (year, month, day).
    TIME: Stores times (hours, minutes, seconds).
    TIMESTAMP: Stores both date and time.
    DATETIME: Similar to TIMESTAMP.
    INTERVAL: Represents a period of time.
    Binary Data Types:

    BINARY(n): Fixed-length binary data with a specified length (n).
    VARBINARY(n): Variable-length binary data with a maximum length of n.
    BLOB: Stores binary large objects, such as images or files.
    Boolean Data Type:

    BOOLEAN: Represents true or false values.
    Enumerated Data Types:

    ENUM: Stores one of a predefined set of values.
    UUID (Universally Unique Identifier): Stores a universally unique identifier.

    JSON Data Type: Stores JSON data.

    XML Data Type: Stores XML documents.

Geospatial Data Types: Used for geographical and spatial data.

Array Data Types: Stores arrays of values.

Row Data Type: Represents a composite type containing multiple fields.

User-Defined Data Types: Some DBMSs allow you to define custom data types.

Each database management system may have additional data types or variations on the above types.
The specific data types available to you will depend on the DBMS you are using, so it's important to consult
the documentation for your particular database system to see the complete list of data types and their details.
